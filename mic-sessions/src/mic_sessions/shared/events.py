"""Transversal aspect: live event delivery.

Every live view reaches the browser through one mechanism: a Server-Sent Events stream served by
`event_stream`, fed by a `Fanout` of bounded subscriber queues. Two kinds of source exist:

- `EventLog`: one session's append-only transcript with a monotonic `seq`. It is the single source of
  truth for the transcript, so its stream is a live tail and a client that reconnects simply replays
  from its last `seq`. The log is a bounded ring buffer (`EVENT_LOG_LIMIT`/`EVENT_LOG_BYTES`); expired
  cursors receive an explicit history reset and a current snapshot from the stream endpoint.
- `Channels`: one live channel per player for everything outside a transcript (session summaries,
  production and backup operations, environment and configuration changes). Nothing is retained:
  a client that (re)connects receives a fresh `sync` snapshot first, then live events.

Each event is serialized exactly once, when it is created, and that frame is shared by every
subscriber. A subscriber that falls behind its bounded queue is dropped rather than allowed to buffer
unboundedly; it reconnects and resumes from its cursor or a fresh snapshot.
